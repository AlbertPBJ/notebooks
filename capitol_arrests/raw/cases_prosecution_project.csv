Calhoun statue in the Capitol building. Calhoun, a South Carolinian infamous for his pro-slavery policies, served as a Congressman and the nation’s seventh Vice President. A statue of his likeness was removed from Marion Square over the Summer of 2020, following a racial reckoning in the wake of the death of George Floyd...Hatley apparently shared the photo with a friend, and it began circulating. Finally, another acquaintance of Hatley (known as Witness 1) sent the photo to the FBI, identifying Hatley and reporting that Hatley drove his car from S.C. to D.C. to participate in the events. Witness 1 also said that Hatley had shared plans to attend the January 6 protests against the certification of 2020 election results. The FBI searched Hatley’s Facebook profile and found that Hatley was working to get out ahead of what he claimed were “rumors” about his participation in the Capitol Riots. The documents detail a Facebook post by Hatley which reads: “It has come to my attention that there was someone who looks like me at the Capitol. Id like to set the record straight. I dont have that kind of motivation for lost causes. I just dont care enough anymore, certainly not enough for all that.”..Despite Hatley’s denial, his cell phone records proved otherwise.
