# Trump tweet frequency

This repo contains a quick analysis of President Trump's tweets — specifically the daily frequency — based on data downloaded in `JSON` format using [Twint](https://github.com/twintproject/twint) and the [Trump Twitter Archive](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive). Also included in this repo is a Jupyter notebook detailing the analysis and chart.
