# Trump tweet frequency

This repo contains the early stages of an analysis of President Trump's tweets — specifically the daily frequency — based on data downloaded in `JSON` format from the [Trump Twitter Archive](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive) and using [Twint](https://github.com/twintproject/twint). Also included in this repo are Jupyter notebooks detailing analysis and charts.
